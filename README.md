# NYT-React-Search

A `NodeJS`, `MongoDB`, `Express`, and `ReactJS` application where users can query, display, and save articles from the New York Times Article Search API(http://developer.nytimes.com/). Users can remove saved articles as well.

This app uses `express` to serve routes and `mongoose` to interact with a `MongoDB` database. On the frontend, the app uses `ReactJS` for rendering components and 'axios` for internal/external API calls.
